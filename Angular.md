# Angular notes

- OnPush change detection strategy (limit child component rerenders to input data changes and internal state changes)
- ngForTrackBy (selective element rendering)
- Detach change detection (NgZone)
- Lazy loading vs preloading
- resolve guards
- streams and async pipes over subscriptions
- rxjs shareReplay
- debouncing/throttling
- web workers
